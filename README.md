# Airbnb Paris Data Analysis Using SQL
# PROJECT BY Ghada SMIDA

## Overview
This project dives into the Airbnb Paris dataset using postgreSQL to uncover trends in pricing, location, room types, cleanliness, and host reputation. The analysis is driven by a set of key business questions, each mapped to a specific objective and backed by SQL queries.

## Dataset

The dataset includes properties data with features like room type, price, cleanliness, guest satisfaction, city center distance, and Superhost status. Initially, the data was stored in two separate files: paris_weekdays.csv and paris_weekends.csv. These two tables have been combined into one dataset for easier analysis.
You can access the dataset from the following URL: 

- **Dataset URL:** [Airbnb Prices in European Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities/data)

## Objectives
1.	Analyze the distribution of room types.
2.	Understand the relationship between price and guest satisfaction.
3.	Evaluate the impact of location on pricing (city center, metro station proximity).
4.	Examine cleanliness ratings and their relationship with guest satisfaction.
5.	Investigate the performance of superhosts vs non-superhosts.
6.	Assess the dynamics of properties on weekends vs weekdays.
7.	Analyze business properties in terms of pricing, guest satisfaction, and location.

## üîç Key Findings

**‚Ä¢ Room Types:** Entire homes/apartments dominate the market and are priced considerably higher than private or shared rooms.

**‚Ä¢	Best Value:** Properties with a good balance of guest satisfaction and reasonable pricing offer the best value, making them ideal for solo travelers and couples.

**‚Ä¢	Location's Impact:** Properties closer to the city center and metro stations are priced higher, reflecting their added convenience and desirable location.

**‚Ä¢	Cleanliness Drives Satisfaction:** There is a clear link between cleanliness ratings and guest satisfaction. Highly rated properties consistently maintain excellent cleanliness standards.

**‚Ä¢	Superhost Advantage:** Superhosts tend to receive higher guest satisfaction ratings and can charge slightly more while still receiving positive reviews.

**‚Ä¢	Weekend Dynamics:** Entire homes and private rooms are generally priced higher during weekdays compared to weekends, while shared rooms see a price increase on weekends. This suggests varying demand patterns and possible pricing strategies based on the type of accommodation and the day of the week.
